The Library of Shannon implements a Markov process to construct a near-infinite library of books whose content is randomly generated in a way that approximates natural written English. 
It is a spin on Jorge Luis Borges' novella "The Library of Babel". It is inspired by Jonathan Basile's virtual rendition of the library and Claude Shannon's book 'The Mathematical Theory of Communication'..
